Patches to improve the behavior of the audio system on the Lenovo Thinkpad X1
Carbon 7th gen. These should also be applicable to the X1 Yoga 4th gen.

I've tested the patches under Debian Unstable, over a 5.6.13 kernel with the
rest of the instructions provided here:
https://gist.github.com/hamidzr/dd81e429dc86f4327ded7a2030e7d7d9#gistcomment-3204561

Improvements compared to the mainline driver:
* max sound output level is raised
  See the analysis here:
  https://gist.github.com/hamidzr/dd81e429dc86f4327ded7a2030e7d7d9#gistcomment-3214171
* independent control of output level on the two sets of speakers (front/back
  aka. tweeters/woofers)

Issues:
* There is some slight "pop" in headphones when content volume transitions
  to/from 0. This is especially easy to notice with voice content where there
  are pauses of silence. For example, I can hear it when listening to the
  first 15s of this video: https://youtu.be/DmtpQZVzm1A

  Also present on mainline.
* When unplugging the headphones, pulseaudio does not automatically switch the
  "Port" of the output device back to "Speakers".

  Also present on mainline.

It might be possible to fix the port switching issue and to get rid of patch
"Rename some controls for the benefit of pulseaudio" by tweaking the
pulseaudio configuration of profile/paths. See the log of that patch for more
info.

If you try the patches, please send me a mail to let me know of your results.
You can also open an issue here or post a comment in the above gist which has
become a forum for audio issues with the X1 Carbon 7th gen.
