Patches to improve the behavior of the audio system on the Lenovo Thinkpad X1
Carbon 7th gen. These should also be applicable to the X1 Yoga 4th gen.

I've tested the patches under Debian Unstable with a self-compiled kernel,
patched alsa ucm profile and the rest of the instructions provided here:
https://gist.github.com/hamidzr/dd81e429dc86f4327ded7a2030e7d7d9#gistcomment-3204561

Both the kernel driver (snd_hda_codec_realtek) and the alsa ucm profile must
be patched. On Debian, the ucm file to patch is found under
/usr/share/alsa/ucm2/sof-hda-dsp/

Note that the ucm patch is over alsa-ucm-conf commit 38e5906cd1b1
("sof-hda-dsp: fix the device order (Hdmi devices)"). At the moment
(alsa-ucm-conf git head ffe0cab5cfce ("sof-hda-dsp: use
sof-hda-dsp/Hdmi.conf")), newer versions do not work for me (with or without
the changes in this repository).

Improvements compared to the mainline driver:
* max sound output level is raised
  See the analysis here:
  https://gist.github.com/hamidzr/dd81e429dc86f4327ded7a2030e7d7d9#gistcomment-3214171
* independent control of output level on the two sets of speakers (front/back
  aka. tweeters/woofers)

Issues:
* There is some slight "pop" in headphones when content volume transitions
  to/from 0. This is especially easy to notice with voice content where there
  are pauses of silence. For example, I can hear it when listening to the
  first 15s of this video: https://youtu.be/DmtpQZVzm1A

  Also present on mainline.

If you try the patches, please send me a mail to let me know of your results.
You can also open an issue here or post a comment in the above gist which has
become a forum for audio issues with the X1 Carbon 7th gen.

Userspace alternative
=====================
Instead of patching the kernel, it is possible to use the `hda-verb` utility
(available from the "alsa-tools" package on Debian) to achieve a similar
effect. This can be done temporarily by running:
hda-verb /dev/snd/hwC0D0 0x17 SET_CONNECT_SEL 1

To make the effect persistent, two changes must be done:
1)
The fixup must be applied each time the device is initialized, ie. at boot and
after resume from S3 suspend AFAIK. A sample systemd service file to do so has
been posted here:
https://gist.github.com/hamidzr/dd81e429dc86f4327ded7a2030e7d7d9#gistcomment-3345062

2)
In order to have effective volume control, pulseaudio must use the "Master"
volume slider. To do so, the relevant ucm profile must be changed. The patch
is slightly different than the one contained in this repository because there
is no renamed control to key off of.
